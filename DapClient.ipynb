    "# DAP CLIENT\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dap Client` plays a pivotal role in the interaction between the client and the server, acting as a bridge that enables the communication between the user and the `DAP Server`. Its primary responsibilities and functionalities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establishing Connection:**\n",
    "   The client initiates and maintains a stable connection to the server, facilitating the exchange of information between the user and the server. It uses the `socket` library to form this connection, specifying the hostname and port number of the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sending Requests:**\n",
    "   The client has the capability to format and send various requests to the `DAP Server`. These requests can range from initializing the debugger with a specific executable path, setting arguments and breakpoints, to starting the debugger and executing other debugger commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Receiving Responses:**\n",
    "   Post the dispatch of requests, the client eagerly awaits the server’s response. It interprets the incoming messages, decoding them from their JSON format and presenting them to the user in a readable and understandable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Timeouts:**\n",
    "   The client is equipped to manage scenarios where the server response is delayed or not received within a specified timeframe, ensuring that the user is informed of any delays or issues in the communication process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Closing Connection:**\n",
    "   Upon completion of the debugging session or when the user decides to terminate the session, the client efficiently closes the connection with the server, ensuring that all resources are released appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Resetting Connection:**\n",
    "   The client can reset the connection if needed, allowing users to restart their debugging sessions without manual interruptions or reconfigurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance:\n",
    "The manifestation of the debugger client, as illustrated, does not have to be rigid in its form; its essence lies in its protocol adherence rather than its structural embodiment. Any programs capable of sending and dispatching JSON-RPC messages, conforming to the socket-based wire protocol, can essentially assume the role of a debugger client. This inherent flexibility means that a wide spectrum of applications, tools, or interfaces, regardless of their design paradigms or operational contexts, can interact with the server, exchanging information seamlessly. This means tools like IDE's (Visual Studio, IntelliJ, etc) can conform to this by allowing for a method to send and receive the DAP communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s this adaptability in communication that enables diverse and disparate systems to utilize, send, and receive data, fostering an inclusive ecosystem where varied components can coalesce to leverage the functionalities provided by the DebugServer. The universal language of JSON-RPC over sockets ensures that the dialogue between client and server remains coherent and standardized, granting different implementations the liberty to focus on their unique value propositions while maintaining interoperability."

    "### Example Usage: DebuggerClient with `helloworld`\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates the utilization of `DebuggerClient` to initialize and interact with a simple program, `helloworld`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization:\n",
    "Here, the client establishes a connection and transmits an `initialize` command, defining the path to the `helloworld` executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Arguments:\n",
    "Subsequently, the `setArgs` command is dispatched to supply \"Hello World\" as an argument to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Placing a Breakpoint:\n",
    "The `setBreakpointAtLine` command is utilized to institute a breakpoint at line `22`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Execution Commencement:\n",
    "The `start` command is propagated to inaugurate the execution of the program, which will suspend at the appointed breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminating Connection:\n",
    "Post the completion of the desired interactions, the `close_connection()` method is invoked to terminate the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Note:** The range and scope of interactions aren't limited to the demonstrated commands. Depending on the functionalities implemented on the server side, a variety of additional commands can be incorporated, thus broadening the array of feasible interactions and capabilities provided by the server.\n"
