    "# Bridging Debugging Gaps: Creating a DAP-Compatible Debug Adapter between Binaries and Debuggers\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook serves as the codebase for the implementation of the Debug Adapter using the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) for our thesis project. Our objective is to bridge various development tools with the GDB debugger, thereby providing a unified interface for debugging across multiple platforms.\n",

    "A Debug Adapter serves as an intermediary between a development environment and a debugger. Instead of each tool having its own unique interface for every debugger, the Debug Adapter Protocol provides a common set of conventions that can be used by any tool to communicate with any debugger. This results in significant efficiency gains as development tools can now interact with a variety of debuggers through a standardized protocol.\n"

    "# Introduction to GDB (GNU Debugger)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this thesis, GDB, which stands for **GNU Debugger**, plays a crucial role in facilitating the debugging and analysis of computer programs written in languages like C and C++. GDB is a powerful and versatile tool that serves as a debugger for various programming languages. In this section, we will provide an overview of GDB, its significance, and the reasons for its inclusion in our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role of GDB\n",
    "\n",
    "**GDB** serves as a debugging tool used by software developers and researchers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify and Fix Bugs**: GDB allows developers to identify and rectify errors, also known as bugs, within their source code. These bugs can range from simple syntax errors to complex logical issues that affect the program's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inspect Program Execution**: GDB provides the capability to inspect a program's execution step by step. This includes examining variables, memory, and the call stack to understand how a program behaves during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Breakpoints**: Breakpoints are markers set within the code to pause program execution at specific points. GDB allows developers to set breakpoints, making it easier to examine the program's state at critical junctures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyze Core Dumps**: When a program crashes, GDB can be used to analyze core dump files, providing valuable insights into the state of the program at the time of the crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Profiling and Performance Analysis**: GDB can be utilized for profiling and performance analysis, helping developers optimize their code for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We select GDB (GNU Debugger) for our thesis due to its essential role in debugging and analyzing complex software systems.\n"
